Challenge of Machine Learning.

## Objective
Predict the gender of a person (male or female) from features extracted from a photograph. Unlike a binary classification problem where the output must be 0 or 1, we have the ability to predict 0 which means that we do not know.

## Data
Provided by Morpho: http://www.morpho.com.

Training set: 105'000 samples x 128 features.

Testing set: 8496 photos to predict.
